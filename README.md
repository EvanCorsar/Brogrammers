## Description 

Our app is solely designed for instructors and students. As an **instructor**, you are assigned to a certain course and is their responsibility to issue assignments or plan a test. So, they can add assignments or schedule tests on our app. As a **student**, you are enrolled into a couple of classes, where you can see deadlines of the assignments or if there are any test scheduled. As an **admin**, you have access to everything. Admins can create or remove instructors, courses or students. They, also, can assign those instructors or students to the courses. 

As students, we really feel that creating an app that keeps track of assignment and test would really help others. For instance, it is very hard to keep up with all the due dates for assignments, especially if you are taking many classes. Students tend to become overwhelmed and are unable to plan properly or can easily forget them resulting in a bad grade. Our app helps students keep track of what is upcoming so they can plan accordingly.
