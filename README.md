## Description (100-word minimum)

Our app is solely designed for instructors and students. As an instructor, you are assigned to a certain course and it is their responsibility to issue assignments or plan a test. So, they can add assignments or schedule tests on our app. As a student, you are enrolled into couple of classes, where you can see deadlines of the assignments or ifÂ  are any test scheduled. As an admin, you have access to everything, like creating or removing instructors, courses or students. Also, they can assign those instructors or students to the courses. 
As students, we really feel that creating an app that keeps track of assignment and test would really others. For instance, it is very hard to keep up with all the due dates for assignments, especially if you are taking many classes, and students tend to be overwhelmed and won't be able to plan properly or can easily forget them and get a bad grade. Our app helps students keep track of what is upcoming so they can plan accordingly.
